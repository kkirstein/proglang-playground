proglang-playground
===================

A playground for various programming languages.

# ATS

[ATS](http://www.ats-lang.org) is a statically-typed programming language that support functional and imperative styles. Its type system supports dependent types and enables theorem proofing of its implementations.

# Clojure

Clojure is a LISP-style language for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

# ClojureScript

ClojureScript is a Clojure dialect (mainly a subset) for web development, as it compiles to JavaScript.

# Common Lisp

A standardized version of LISP, containing an object system (CLOS) and many libraries.

# Crystal

[Crystal](https://www.crystal-lang.org) is a compiled programming language with a static type system. It features a Ruby-like syntax and utilizes the LLVM toolchain for high performance of te built executables.

# Elixir

A functional programmig language for the Erlang virtual machine. It features macros, strong concurrency features (Erlang!) and an expressive syntax ala Ruby.

# Elm

Elm is a Haskell-style programming language for web development. It compiles to JavaScript and features Functional Reactive Programming for GUIs.

# Go

Go is a mainly imperative programming language with a static type system. Go has a strong emphasis on concurrency via channels, aka goroutines.

# Fortran

Fortran is an imperative programming language, well establised for scientific computing and other number-crunching tasks.

# Frege

Frege is a Haskell implementation for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

# Haskell

Haskell is a pure functional programming language with a very powerful static type system.

# Haxe

Haxe is a programming language mainly for the web that compiles to JavaScript, Flash, Neko (a VM for web server) or to native code (via C).

Haxe is statically typed and supports algebraic data types ala Haskell.

# Idris

[Idris](http://www.idris-lang.org/) is a Haskell-style programming language with [dependent types](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type). It compiles to either machine code (via C) or to JavaScript.

# Kotlin

[Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org) is a statically-typed object-oriented programming language, targetting the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and now also compiles to JavaScript. Its main goal is to reduce the complexity (aka boilerplate) and avoid some pitfalls, like null pointers, of the Java programming language.

# Lua

Lua is a small dynamically typed "scripting" language. Due to its size it is very well suited to be embedded into applications. It also features a very easy interface to native (C) code. LuaJIT is an alternative implementation with increased performance by LIT-compilation.

# Nim

Nim (formerly Nimrod) is an imperative programming language that compiles to native code via C. It is designed for better safety than C to prevent errors especially for multithreaded programs.

# OCaml

[OCaml](http://www.ocaml.org) is a functional programming language that also supports imperative and object-oriented style. It is statically typed and derived from the [ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_%28programming_language%29) language.

# Perl

[Perl](http://www.perl.org) is a general purpose scripting language with a large set of supporting libraries. It is very well suited for an kind of text processing thanks to its powerful regular expression engine. [Perl6](http://perl6.org) is a modern dialect of Perl, recently released.

# Pony

[Pony](http://www.ponylang.org) is a statically typed programming language with built-in support for actors, like they are known from Scala of Erlang. In contrast, pony compiles to native code without using a dedicated runtime engine.

# Python

Python is an interpreted general purpose programming language. Due to its wide spread, bindings to many popular libraries and frameworks are available, especially in the field of scientific computing

# Racket

[Racket](http://racket-lang.org/) is a Scheme dialect with emphasis on teaching computer science. It features the definition and usage of new programming language variants. Its infrastructure contains a large number of packages for different application areas. DrRacket is a multi-platform developement environment. This might enable the usage of Racket also for other disciplines besides education.

# Ruby

[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) is a general purpose interpreted programming language with an expressive syntax. It is well known for the Rails web application framework.

# Rust

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) is a statically typed programming language with good support for multithreading. It features a concept of variable ownership to prevent data races, deadlocks, etc.

# Scheme

Scheme is a LISP-style programming language, mainly used for teaching. It is standardized (currently as R7RS) and contains a standard library for doing basic tasks like file-IO, etc. There are various implementations for Scheme, mostly compatible to the R7RS standard.

# Swift

[Swift](https://swift.org) is Apples successor of Objective-C and a statically-typed programming language with object-oriented and functional features.
