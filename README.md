proglang-playground
===================

A playground for various programming languages.

# ATS

[ATS](http://www.ats-lang.org) is a statically-typed programming language that support functional and imperative styles. Its type system supports dependent types and enables theorem proofing of its implementations.

# Clojure

Clojure is a LISP-style language for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

# ClojureScript

ClojureScript is a Clojure dialect (mainly a subset) for web development, as it compiles to JavaScript.

# Common Lisp

A standardized version of LISP, containing an object system (CLOS) and many libraries.

# Elixir

A functional programmig language for the Erlang virtual machine. It features macros, strong concurrency features (Erlang!) and an expressive syntax ala Ruby.

# Elm

Elm is a Haskell-style programming language for web development. It compiles to JavaScript and features Functional Reactive Programming for GUIs.

# Frege

Frege is a Haskell implementation for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

# Haskell

Haskell is a pure functional programming language with a very powerful static type system.

# Haxe

Haxe is a programming language mainly for the web that compiles to JavaScript, Flash, Neko (a VM for web server) or to native code (via C).

Haxe is statically typed and supports algebraic data types ala Haskell.

# Idris

[Idris](http://www.idris-lang.org/) is a Haskell-style programming language with [dependent types](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type). It compiles to either machine code (via C) or to JavaScript.

# Lua

Lua is a small dynamically typed "scripting" language. Due to its size it is very well suited to be embedded into applications. It also features a very easy interface to native (C) code. LuaJIT is an alternative implementation with increased performance by LIT-compilation.

# Nim

Nim (formerly Nimrod) is an imperative programming language that compiles to native code via C. It is designed for better safety than C to prevent errors especially for multithreaded programs.

# Pony

[Pony](http://www.ponylang.org) is a statically typed programming language with built-in support for actors, like they are known from Scala of Erlang. In contrast, pony compiles to native code without using a dedicated runtime engine.

# Rust

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) is a statically typed programming language with good support for multithreading. It features a concept of variable ownership to prevent data races, deadlocks, etc.
